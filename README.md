## Introduction to the project

Tap Match Recycle is a game developed as technical assessment for Rovio's recruitment process for the Unity Game Developer role. The repository stores the Unity project, including all the content created by me, as well as all its dependencies it relies on in order to help streamline the review process.

**Development time:** 10 days

## Pitch

Small, isolated actions are irrelevant, but when combined, they can have a big impact in our world. This is how recycling aims to contribute to stopping climate change, a problem that, like it or not, is our reality. Tap Match Recycle encapsulates this concept and aims to teach us how to recycle. With a gesture as simple as a tap of our finger, the player will group residue of the same type and will put it in the corresponding bin.

## Assessment requirements

The requirements for this assessment were:

Create a simple "tap match" Unity game.

- N * M sized tile grid (simple rectangle shaped grid, N and M are from 5 to 20, easily configurable)
- P different colors for matchables (objects on the grid, P is from 3 to 6, easily configurable)
- Infinite playability (no turn limits, player can play as long as he wants)
